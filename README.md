# odin-recipes
This is Project 1 in the course of The Odin Project (TOP) familiarizing myself with HTML, Git, &amp; GitHub. 

By the end of this project, I will be able to:
1. Create a website with multiple webpages
2. Present images and give due credits
3. Work with Git to write commit messages after writing meaningful code
4. Push my work to Github via Git

As there is no CSS, the website is plain and lacks appeal. Therefore, this is version 1 of my first ever functioning website.
