    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        A latke is a type of potato pancake or fritter found in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine. The dish, which is traditionally served during Hanukkah, can be made with grated, shredded, or mashed potatoes. This top-rated recipe is made with shredded russet potatoes, all-purpose flour, an egg, an onion, and salt. The potato latkes are fried in peanut oil.   
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated onion</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice peeled potatoes and run through a food processor fitted with the grater attachment. Place shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring well to remove as much moisture as possible.</li>
        <li>Measure 2 cups shredded, drained potatoes and place into a medium bowl; save any extra for another use. Add egg, flour, onion, and salt, and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Place large spoonfuls of potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick patties. Cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.</li>
        <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you cook any remaining latkes. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
