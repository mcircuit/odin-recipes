    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Yorkshire pudding is a savory popover-like dish made from a simple blend of eggs, milk, and flour. Yorkshire pudding was originally made with drippings from roasted meat, but many modern recipes use oil and butter in its place.   
    </p>

    <p>
         The trademark puffy interior and toasted skin make Yorkshire pudding the perfect vessel for rich sauces, gravies, and meat. It can be baked in one large skillet or separated and poured into a muffin tin for easy sharing. It's a versatile dish that is just as delicious as a starter or as the centerpiece of the meal.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees C.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs and milk together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour.</li>
        <li>Divide butter evenly into the cups of a 12-cup muffin tin, about 1/2 teaspoon per cup.</li>
        <li>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven until butter has melted and is sizzling hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from oven, and distribute batter evenly among each cup.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to 175 degrees C and bake until puffed and golden, without peeking, about 25 minutes more. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
